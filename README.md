South Tree Interactive  V 1.0.0
===============================

Development Staging and Prodction
---------------------------------

1 We will be working and developing off the Master branch since it is the default.
	After all changes made on the local machine push everything to the master branch for back up.

2 Once code is pushed to the Master branch all team members have access to application and can branch off from there.

3 Once new features are added in each developers personal branch they can merge back with the Masterbranch for everyone to test and look for bugs.

4 Once inital testing is complete the feature the developer will be able to merge with the staging server called the gh-pages branch. This will allow for testing in a realworld production enviornment.

5 Once testing has been completed on the staging server the feature will be ready for promotion to the production server. The prodcution server is hosted on a Digital Ocean Droplet which the files have to be downloaded from Git Hup and manually uploaded to the producdtion server.
