Development Staging and Prodction
---------------------------------

1 We will be working and developing locally on our own machines. We will only use the Master branch to upload to at the end of the day for backup and so each team member will have access to the most recent files

2 Once code is pushed to the Master branch all team members have access to most recent  application and can branch off from there into thier own personal development branches.

3 Once new features are added in each developers personal branch they can merge back with the central development branch and test the new feature with existing code and features.

4 Once inital testing is complete the developer will be able to merge with the staging server called the gh-pages branch. This will allow for testing in a realworld production enviornment on a live url.

5 Once testing has been completed on the staging server the feature will be ready for promotion to the production server. The prodcution server is hosted on a Digital Ocean Droplet which the files have to be downloaded from Git Hup and manually uploaded to the producdtion server.
